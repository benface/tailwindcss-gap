## [7.0.0] - 2020-08-04

### Changed
- Got rid of the internal hack we used in order to support variants, thanks to Tailwind’s `addComponents()` accepting a `variants` option since v1.5

### Removed
- Removed the `legacy` option; use Tailwind’s `target` option instead (see `README` for more information)

## [6.0.0] - 2020-04-19

### Added
- Added a `c-gap-wrapper` class which should be used to wrap `c-gap` / `c-gap-padding` elements in order to avoid issues related to collapsing margins

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where gaps wouldn’t work after passing through a CSS minifier

## [5.0.2] - 2020-03-08

### Fixed
- Fixed botched release of v5.0.1
- Fixed an issue where a `0` gap in one dimension would break the gaps in the other dimension (e.g. `c-gap c-gap-x-4 c-gap-y-0`)

## [5.0.1] - 2020-03-08

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where a `0` gap in one dimension would break the gaps in the other dimension (e.g. `c-gap c-gap-x-4 c-gap-y-0`)

## [5.0.0] - 2020-02-06

### Added
- Added the `prefix` option which is set to `c-` by default to avoid conflicting with Tailwind 1.2’s `gap` classes (sorry about that!)

## [4.0.0] - 2020-02-05

### Changed
- Changed to use Tailwind 1.2’s new plugin definition syntax
- Gaps are now generated by default using the theme’s `spacing` scale (they can be extended with `theme.extend.gap`, or replaced with `theme.gap`)

## [3.1.1] - 2019-07-11

### Fixed
- Fixed the generated variant selectors in `legacy` mode (requires Tailwind v1.0.5+)

## [3.1.0] - 2019-07-08

### Added
- Added a `legacy` option to generate IE-compatible CSS (no custom properties)

## [3.0.0] - 2019-05-15

### Changed since 3.0.0-beta.1
- Added support for global variants thanks to Tailwind’s `variants()` helper function

### Fixed since 3.0.0-beta.1
- `gap-*` utilities with variants now correctly override `gap-x-*` and `gap-y-*` utilities (e.g. `gap-x-4 gap-y-2 sm:gap-0` now removes all gaps at the `sm` breakpoint as expected)

### Added since 2.x
- Tailwind 1.0.0 compatibility

### Changed since 2.x
- The plugin doesn’t accept a config object anymore; instead it finds what it needs in the `theme` and `variants` keys of your config (see `README` for more info)
- Responsive variants are now generated by default

## [3.0.0-beta.1] - 2019-04-07

### Added
- Tailwind 1.0.0 compatibility

### Changed
- The plugin doesn’t accept a config object anymore; instead it finds what it needs in the `theme` and `variants` keys of your config (see `README` for more info)
- Responsive variants are now generated by default

## [2.0.0] - 2019-03-29

### Added
- A base `gap` class now needs to be added to gap containers in addition to the `gap-*`, `gap-x-*`, and/or `gap-y-*` classes
- Added an alternative `gap-padding` base class to use padding on gap children, instead of margin

### Changed
- The generated CSS now uses custom properties to avoid repetition, so the resulting CSS is much smaller

## [1.1.0] - 2019-03-02

### Changed
- Gaps are now generated as components instead of utilities, in order for them to be overridable by margin utilities

## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-19

### Fixed
- Fixed bug where gaps were twice as large as the specified value

## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-17
